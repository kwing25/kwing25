## GitHub Profile Counter

- Counter image, initially based on pixel.svg from [Flavio Copes](https://flaviocopes.com/count-visits-static-site/)

- This is for use on [my GitHub profile](https://github.com/greenido), but you should be able to remix it and keep track of your profile's count as well.

- This will reset any time the server is inactive or shutdown. Ideally, you would hook this up to a database.
